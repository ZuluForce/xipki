#db.connectionProperties=

# The default auto-commit state of connections created by this pool.
# Default: true
db.defaultAutoCommit=true

# The default read-only state of connections created by this pool.
# (Some drivers don't support read only mode, ex: Informix)
# Default: driver default
db.defaultReadOnly=false

# The default TransactionIsolation state of connections created by this pool.
# One of the following:
#       0: NONE,
#       1: READ_COMMITTED
#       2: READ_UNCOMMITTED
#       4: REPEATABLE_READ
#       8: SERIALIZABLE
# Default: driver default
#
db.defaultTransactionIsolation=1

# The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at
# the same time, or negative for no limit.
# Default: 8
#
db.maxActive=60

# The minimum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra
# ones being created, or zero to create none. 
# Default: 0
#
db.minIdle=5

# The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no
# available connections) for a connection to be returned before throwing an
# exception. 
db.maxWait=30000

# This property controls the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that a
# connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Whether a connection is retired
# as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average
# variation of +15 seconds. A connection will never be retired as idle before this
# timeout. A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the
# pool. Default: 600000 (10 minutes)
#
# db.idleTimeout = 600000

# This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. When a
# connection reaches this timeout, even if recently used, it will be retired from
# the pool. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is idle will
# it be removed. We strongly recommend setting this value, and using something
# reasonable like 30 minutes or 1 hour. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime
# (infinite lifetime)
# Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
#
# db.maxLifetime = 1800000
